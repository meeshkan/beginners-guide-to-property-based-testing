Testing your software takes time... a lot of time. When you're writing tests, you're often stuck trying to manually reproduce every potential sequence of events. But what if you wanted to test hundreds (or thousands or even millions) of cases at once? We have an answer: **Property-based testing**.

Maybe you've written unit tests before, but this is the first time you've heard about property-based testing. Or maybe you've heard the term, but still don't really get what it's about. Either way, we've got you. 

Throughout this guide, we'll cover the fundamentals of property-based testing. We'll walk you through practical examples and how to structure your tests. Finally, you'll learn how to use property-based testing to find bugs in your code and what existing libraries are out there.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisites**:
- A general understanding of what unit tests are.
- (Optional) [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)* if you want to follow along in your own IDE. 

_* This guide will use Python for code examples, but the concepts aren't limited to any specific programming language. So even if you don't know Python, we'd encourage you to read along anyway._

üíª **References**:
We've created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meeshkan/beginners-guide-to-property-based-testing) to go with this guide. All of the featured code examples exist there as unit tests and include instructions for how to execute them.

## Traditional unit tests based on examples

Most often, software testing is done using **example-based testing**. This means you test that for a given argument, you get a known return value. This return value is known because, well, you provided that exact value as a sample. So when you run the function or test system, it then asserts the actual result against that sample return value.

Let's look at an example. Say you want to write a function called `sort_this_list`. This function will take a [list](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) as an argument and return the same list organized in ascending order. To do this, you'll use the built-in Python [`sorted`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) function.

It might look like the following:

```python
def sort_this_list(input_list):
    sorted_list = sorted(input_list)
    return sorted_list
```

Now that you have your `sort_this_list` function, let's test it. 

To test this using example-based testing, you need to (manually) provide the test function with return values that you know will be `True`. For example, the list `[5, 3, 1, 4, 2]` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` after it's sorted.

```python
def test_sort_this_list():
    assert sort_this_list([5, 3, 1, 4, 2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # True
    assert sort_this_list(['a', 'd', 'c', 'e', 'b']) == ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] # True
```

And with that, you have a passing example-based test üéâ

### Limitations of example-based testing

While example-based tests work well in many situations and provide an (arguably) low barrier of entry to testing, they do have downsides. Particularly that you have to create every test case yourself - and you can only test as many cases as you're willing to write. The less you write, the more likely it is that your tests will miss catching bugs in your code.

To show why this could be a problem, let's look at the test for the `sort_this_list` function from the last section:

```python
def test_sort_this_list():
    assert sort_this_list([5, 3, 1, 4, 2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # True
    assert sort_this_list(['a', 'd', 'c', 'e', 'b']) == ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] # True
```

Both of these assertions return `True`. So if you only tested these two values, you might believe that the `sort_this_list` function always returns the desired result.

But if you add a third potential return value:

```python
def test_sort_this_list():
    assert sort_this_list([5, 3, 1, 4, 2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
    assert sort_this_list(['a', 'd', 'c', 'e', 'b']) == ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 
    # Add a new test case:
    assert sort_this_list(['a', 2, 'c', 3, 'b', 1]) == ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
```

And then run the test... you'll hit an error:

```bash
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'
```

Turns out the `sort_this_list` function doesn't work as expected when the list contains both integers and strings. Maybe you already knew that, but maybe you would've never known that without a specific test case. 

Even with these limitations, example-based testing will continue to be the norm in software testing. Throughout the rest of this guide, though, we'll explore another technique. One designed to compliment your existing (likely example-based) tests and improve the test coverage of your code.

## Introduction to property-based testing

When thinking about the limitations of example-based testing, many questions come to mind. What if you want to test hundreds of cases? Or ones that you could never dream of coming up with yourself? 

**Property-based testing** is a different approach here to help with that. With property-based testing, you don't generate the exact values manually. Instead, that is done by a computer automatically. 

As the developer, what you have to do is:

- Specify what value to generate.
- Assert on guarantees (or **properties**) that are true regardless of the exact value.

### An example using Hypothesis

To put property-based testing into practice, let's look at an example using [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library for generative test cases. We chose Hypothesis mostly because we're using Python - but also because the documentation is clear and thorough. 

Let's use the `sort_this_list` function from earlier. As a reminder, here's what that looked like:

```python
def sort_this_list(input_list):
    sorted_list = sorted(input_list)
    return sorted_list
```

Now let's write a property-based tests using Hypothesis. To limit the scope, you'll only test for lists of integers:

```python
# test_sorted_list.py
import hypothesis.strategies as some
from hypothesis import given

# Use the @given indicator to guide Hypothesis to the input value needed:
@given(input_list=some.lists(some.integers()))
def test_sort_this_list_properties(input_list):
    sorted_list = sorted(input_list)
    return sorted_list

    # Regardless of input, sorting should never change the size:
    assert len(sorted_list) == len(input_list)

    # Regardless of input, sorting should never change the set of distinct elements:
    assert set(sorted_list) == set(input_list)

    # Regardless of input, each element in the sorted list should be
    # lower or equal to the value that comes after it:
    for i in range(len(sorted_list) - 1):
        assert sorted_list[i] <= sorted_list[i + 1]
```

> Note: If you're following along on your machine, make sure to install [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#installing) and then you can run the tests using [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/).

And there you have it, your first property-based test üéâ

What's especially important here is the use of the [@given](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/details.html#hypothesis.given) function decorator:

```python
@given(input_list=some.lists(some.integers()))
```

This specifies that you want a list of random integers as the input value and **asserts on properties that are true regardless of the exact input**.

If you add a `print(input_list)` statement, you can peek at the _100 different generated input values_:

```
[]
[92]
[66, 24, -25219, 94, -28953, 31131]
[-16316, -367479896]
[-7336253322929551029, -7336253322929551029, 27974, -24308, -64]
...
```

> Note: Your values will likely be different from our example - and that's ok.

The number of runs and specifics of the generated data can be configured. More on that later on.

### What can be a property?

With this style of testing, a **property** is something that's true about the function being tested, regardless of the exact input. 

Let's see this definition applied to assertion examples from the previous `test_sort_this_list_properties` function:
	
- `len(sorted_list) == len(input_list)`: The property tested here is the list length. The length of the sorted list is always the same as the original list (regardless of the specific list items).
- `sorted_list[i] <= sorted_list[i + 1]`: This property was that each element of the sorted list is in ascending order. No matter the contents of the original list, this should be true. 

### How does property-based testing differ from example-based?

While they're from different concepts, property-based tests share many characteristics with example-based tests. This is illustrated in the following comparison of steps you'd take to write a given test:

| Example based                          | Property based                               |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Set up some example data            | 1. Define data type matching a specification |
| 2. Perform some operations on the data | 2. Perform some operations on the data       |
| 3. Assert something about the result   | 3. Assert properties about the result        |

There are several instances where it would be worthwhile to use property-based testing. But the same can be said for example-based testing. They can, and very likely will, co-exist in the same codebase. 

So if you're stressed about having to rewrite your entire test suite to try out property-based testing, don't worry. We wouldn't recommend that. 

## Example properties and how to test for them

By now, we've written our first property-based test and many lists were sorted üéâ But sorting lists isn't a representative example of how you'd use property-based testing in the real world. So we've gathered three example properties and in this section, we'll guide you through how they might be used to test our software.

All of the examples will continue to use the [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) testing library and its [@given](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/details.html#hypothesis.given) function decorator.

### Unexpected exceptions should never be thrown

Something that was tested by default in the previous `test_sorted_list_properties` function was that the code didn't throw any exceptions. The fact that the code doesn't throw any exceptions (or more generally, only expected and documented exceptions, and that it never causes a segmentation fault) is a property. And this property can be a convenient one to test, especially if the code has a lot of internal assertions.

As an example, let's use the [`json.loads`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads) function from the Python standard library. Then, let's test that the `json.loads` function never throws any exceptions other than `json.JSONDecodeError` - regardless of input:

```python
@given(some.text())
def test_json_loads(input_string):
    try:
        json.loads(input_string)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return
```

When you run the test file, it passes üéâ So what we believed held up under testing!

### Values shouldn't change after encoding and then decoding

A commonly tested property is called symmetry. Symmetry proves in certain operations that decoding an encoded value always results in the original value.

Let's apply it to [base32-crockford](https://github.com/jbittel/base32-crockford), a Python library for the [Base32](https://www.crockford.com/base32.html) encoding format:

```python
@given(some.integers(min_value=0))
def test_base32_crockford(input_int):
      assert base32_crockford.decode(base32_crockford.encode(input_int)) == input_int
```

Because this decoding scheme only works for non-negative integers, you need to specify the _generation strategy_ of your input data. That's why, in this example, `some.integers(min_value=0)` is added to the `@given` decorator. It restricts Hypothesis to only generate integers with a minium value of zero.

Once again, the test passes üéâ

### A naive method should still give the same result

Sometimes, you can get the desired solution through a naive, unpractical way that isn't acceptable to use in production code. This might be due to the execution time being too slow, memory consumption being too high or it requiring specific dependencies that aren't acceptable to install in production.

For example, consider counting the number of set bits in an (arbitrary sized) integer, where you have an optimized solution from the [pygmp2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

Let's compare this with a slower solution that converts the integer to a binary string (using the [bin](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bin) function in the Python standard library) and then counts the occurences of the string `"1"` inside of it:

```python
def count_bits_slow(input_int):
    return bin(input_int).count("1")

@given(some.integers(min_value=0))
@settings(max_examples=500)
def test_gmpy2_popcount(input_int):
    assert count_bits_slow(input_int) == gmpy2.popcount(input_int)
```

For illustrative purposes, this example specifies a [`@settings(max_examples=500)`](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html) decorator to tweak the default number of input values to generate.

The test passes  üéâ - showing that the optimized, hard-to-follow code of `gmpy2.popcount` gives the same results as the slower but less complex `count_bits_slow` function. 

> Note: If this was the only reason to bring in gmpy2 as a dependency, it'd be wise to benchmark if the performance improvements of it really would outweigh the cost and weight of the dependency.

## Finding bugs with property-based testing

We've gone over the concepts of property-based testing and seen various properties in action - this is great. But one of the selling points of property-based tests is that they're supposed to help us find more bugs. And we haven't found any bugs yet.

So let's go hunting. 

For this example, let's use the [json5](https://pypi.org/project/json5/) library for [JSON5](https://json5.org/) serialization. It's a bit niche, sure, but it's also a younger project. This means that you're more likely to uncover a bug compared to a more established library. 

The json5 library contains: 

- One **property** of JSON5 is that it is a superset of JSON.
- Another **property** proving that deserializing a serialized string should give you back the original object.

Let's use those properties in a test:

```python
import json
from string import printable

import hypothesis.strategies as some
import json5
from hypothesis import example, given, settings

# Construct a generator of arbitrary objects to test serialization on:
some_object = some.recursive(
    some.none() | some.booleans() | some.floats(allow_nan=False) | some.text(printable),
    lambda children: some.lists(children, min_size=1)
    | some.dictionaries(some.text(printable), children, min_size=1),
)

@given(some_object)
def test_json5_loads(input_object):
    dumped_json_string = json.dumps(input_object)
    dumped_json5_string = json5.dumps(input_object)

    parsed_object_from_json = json5.loads(dumped_json_string)
    parsed_object_from_json5 = json5.loads(dumped_json5_string)

    assert parsed_object_from_json == input_object
    assert parsed_object_from_json5 == input_object
```

After creating a `some_object` generator of [arbitrary objects](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#recursive-data), you can verify aspects of the previously mentioned properties: You serialize the input using both `json` and `json5`. Then, you deserialize those two objects back using the `json5` library and assert that the original object was obtained.

But doing this, you'll run into a problem. At the `json5.dumps(input_object)` statement, you get an exception inside the internals of the `json5` library:

```python
    def _is_ident(k):
        k = str(k)
>       if not _is_id_start(k[0]) and k[0] not in (u'$', u'_'):
E       IndexError: string index out of range
```

Besides showing the stack trace, as usual, you also get an informative message showing the failed _hypothesis_ - otherwise known as the generated data that caused the test to fail:

```
# ------------- Hypothesis ------------- #
Falsifying example: test_json5_loads(
    input_object={'': None},
)
```

Using the `{'': None}` input data caused [the issue that was promptly reported](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/37). Finding the issue led to [fixing the bug](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/38). This fix has since been released in version 0.9.4 of the json5 library.

> We want to add that the fix was merged and released within 20 minutes of reporting. Very impressive work by json5 maintainer [@dpranke](https://github.com/dpranke) üëè

But what about the future, how can you be sure that the problem will never resurface? 

Because the data currently generated contains the troublesome input (`{'': None}`), you want to ensure that this input is always used. This should be true even if someone tweaks the `some_object` generator or updates the version of Hypothesis used.

The following fix uses the [@example](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reproducing.html#hypothesis.example) decorator to add a hard-coded example to the generated input:

## Available libraries

This guide uses the [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for Python. But there's a lot of functionality that wasn't covered and, as previously mentioned, the documentation is nice. We'd recommend checking it out if you're a Python user.

If you're not using Python, no problem. There are several other libraries built for property-based testing, in a variety of languages:

- [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check): TypeScript
- [FsCheck](https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/): .NET
- [jqwik](https://jqwik.net/): Java
- [PropCheck](https://github.com/alfert/propcheck): Elixir
- [PropEr](https://proper-testing.github.io/): Erlang
- [RapidCheck](https://github.com/emil-e/rapidcheck): C++
- [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck): Haskell
- [QuickCheck ported to Rust](https://docs.rs/quickcheck/0.9.2/quickcheck/): Rust

## Conclusion

Example-based testing isn't going anywhere any time soon. But we hope that, after reading this guide, you're motivated to incorporate some property-based tests into your codebase.
