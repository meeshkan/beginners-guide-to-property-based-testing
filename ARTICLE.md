<!-- INTRODUCTION SENTENCE -->

Maybe you've written unit tests before, but this is the first time you've heard about property-based testing. Or maybe you've heard the term, but still don't really get what it's about. Either way, we've got you. 

In this guide, we'll cover the fundamentals of property-based testing and how it differs from traditional example-based testing practices. We'll walk you through practical examples of properties and how to write tests that address them. Finally, we'll learn how to use property-based testing to find bugs in our code and what existing libraries are out there.

‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites:
<!-- It'd be great to link to a resource for learning about software testings, but I'm not sure which one would be the best ü§î -->
- A general understanding of how software testing works.
- (Optional) [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)* if you want to follow along in your own IDE. 

_* This guide will use Python for code examples, but the concepts aren't limited to Python specifically. So even if you don't know Python, we'd encourage you to read along anyway._

## Traditional unit tests based on examples
Most often, software testing is done using **example-based testing**. This means you test that for a given argument, you get a known return value. This return value is known because, well, you provided that value as a sample. So when the you run the function or test system, it then asserts the actual result against that sample return value.

Let's look at an example. Say we wanted to write a function called `sort_this_list` that takes a [list](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) as an argument and returns the same list organized in ascending order.

It might look like the following:

```python
def sort_this_list(list):
    sorted_list = sorted(list)
    return sorted_list
```

Now that we have our `sort_this_list` function, let's test it. 

To test this using example-based testing, we need to provide the test function with return values that we know will be `True`. For example, the list `[5, 3, 1, 4, 2]` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` after it's sorted.

```python
# Function that organizes list items in ascending order:
def sort_this_list(list):
    sorted_list = sorted(list)
    return sorted_list

# Test for our function that uses two manually determined return values:
def test_sort_this_list():
    assert sort_this_list([5, 3, 1, 4, 2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # True
    assert sort_this_list(['a', 'd', 'c', 'e', 'b']) == ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] # True
```

And with that, we have a passing example-based test üéâ

### Limitations of example-based testing

While example-based tests work well in many situations and provide an (arguably) low barrier of entry to testing, they do have downsides. Particularly that you have to manually create every return value - and you can only test as many values as you're willing to write. The less we write, the more likely it is that our tests miss catching bugs in our code.

To show why this could be a problem, let's look at the test for the `sort_this_list` function from the last section:

<!-- I don't love this example, but I wanted to provide a code sample and ideally use the same list example from the last section to prove our point. We could also do something with integer vs float values ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è -->

```python
def test_sort_this_list():
    assert sort_this_list([5, 3, 1, 4, 2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # True
    assert sort_this_list(['a', 'd', 'c', 'e', 'b']) == ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] # True
```

Both of these assertions return `True`. So if you only tested these two values, you might believe that the `sort_this_list` function always returns the desired result.

However, if we add a third value:

```python
def test_sort_this_list():
    assert sort_this_list([5, 3, 1, 4, 2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
    assert sort_this_list(['a', 'd', 'c', 'e', 'b']) == ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 
    # Add a new test case:
    assert sort_this_list(['a', 2, 'c', 3, 'b', 1]) == ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
```

And then run the test... we hit an error:

```bash
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'
```

Turns out our `sort_this_list` function doesn't work properly when the list contains both integers and strings. Maybe you already knew that, but maybe we would've never known that without a specific test case. 

Even with these limitations, example-based testing will continue to be the norm in software testing. Throughout the rest of this guide, though, we'll explore an additional technique designed to compliment your existing (likely example-based) tests and enhance the test coverage of your code.

## Introduction to property-based testing

When we think about the limitations of example-based testing, many questions come to mind. What if we want to test hundreds (or millions) of test cases? Or possibly ones we could never dream of coming up with ourselves? 

**Property-based testing** is a different approach here to help with that. With property-based testing, you don't generate the exact values manually. Instead, that is done by a computer automatically. 

As the developer, what you have to do is:

- Specify what value to generate.
- Assert on guarantees (or **properties**) that are true regardless of the exact value.

### An example using Hypothesis

To put property-based testing into practice, let's look at an example using [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library for generative test cases. We chose Hypothesis mostly because we're using Python - but also because the documentation is clear and thorough. 

We'll use our `sort_this_list` function from earlier. As a reminder, here's what that looked like:

```python
def sort_this_list(input_list):
    sorted_list = sorted(input_list)
    return sorted_list
```

Now let's write our property-based tests using Hypothesis. To limit the scope, we'll only test for lists of integers.

```python
# Including the necessary imports from Hypothesis
import hypothesis.strategies as some
from hypothesis import given

# Use the @given indicator to guide Hypothesis to what input value we need:
@given(input_list=some.lists(some.integers()))
def test_sort_this_list_properties(input_list):
    sorted_list = sorted(input_list)
    return sorted_list

    # Regardless of input, sorting should never change the size:
    assert len(sorted_list) == len(input_list)

    # Regardless of input, sorting should never change the set of distinct elements:
    assert set(sorted_list) == set(input_list)

    # Regardless of input, each element in the sorted list should be
    # lower or equal to the value that comes after it:
    for i in range(len(sorted_list) - 1):
        assert sorted_list[i] <= sorted_list[i + 1]
```

What's especially important here is the use of the [@given](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/details.html#hypothesis.given) function decorator:

```python
@given(input_list=some.lists(some.integers()))
```

This specifies that we want a list of random integers as the input value and **asserts on properties that are true regardless of the exact input**.

If we add a `print(input_list)` statement, we can peek at the _100 different generated input values_:

```
[]
[92]
[66, 24, -25219, 94, -28953, 31131]
[-16316, -367479896]
[-7336253322929551029, -7336253322929551029, 27974, -24308, -64]
...
```

The number of runs and specifics of the generated data can be configured. More on that later on.

### What can be a property?

<!-- Ugh I really want to add this section but struggling to figure out exactly what to say üò© -->

### How does property-based testing differ from example-based?

While they originate from different concepts, a property-based test shares many characteristics with how an example-based test is written. This is illustrated in the following comparison of steps:

| Example based                          | Property based                               |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Set up some example data            | 1. Define data type matching a specification |
| 2. Perform some operations on the data | 2. Perform some operations on the data       |
| 3. Assert something about the result   | 3. Assert properties about the result        |

There are several instances where it would be worthwhile to use property-based testing. But the same can be said for example-based testing. They can, and very likely will, co-exist in the same codebase. So if you were stressed about having to rewrite your entire test suite to try out property-based testing, don't worry. We wouldn't recommend that. 

## Example properties and how to test for them

<!-- Description of why we have these sections! -->

### Unexpected exceptions should never be thrown
One thing we got tested "for free" in the above `test_bubble_sort_properties` function, was that the code did not throw any exception. This property - that the code does not throw any exception (or more generally, only expected and documented exceptions, and that it never segfaults) - can be a convenient one to test, especially if the code has a lot of internal assertions.

Let's test that the property that the [json.loads](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads) function in the python standard library never throws any exception other than `json.JSONDecodeError` regardless of input:

```python
@given(some.text())
def test_json_loads(input_string):
    try:
        json.loads(input_string)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return
```

Running the test passes, so what we believe held up under test!

### Values shouldn't change after encoding and then decoding
Symmetry of certain operations can sometimes be used, as in the property that decoding an encoded value always results in the original value.

Let's apply it to [base32-crockford](https://github.com/jbittel/base32-crockford), a python library for the [Base32](https://www.crockford.com/base32.html) encoding format:

```python
@given(some.integers(min_value=0))
def test_base32_crockford(input_int):
      assert base32_crockford.decode(base32_crockford.encode(input_int)) == input_int
```

Since this decoding scheme only works for non-negative integers, we specify to the **generation strategy** of input data to only generate integers with a minium value of zero: `some.integers(min_value=0)`. Once again the test passes.

### A naive method should still give the same result
Sometimes we can get the desired solution through a naive, unpractical way that is not acceptable to use in production code: That might be due to execution time being to slow, memory consumption too high or it requiring special dependencies that are not acceptable to install in production.

For an example, consider counting the number of set bits in an (arbitrary sized) integer, where we have an optimized solution from the [pygmp2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

Let's compare with a slower solution that converts the integer to a binary string (using the [bin](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bin) function in the standard library) and then counts the occurences of the string "1" inside it:

```python
def count_bits_slow(input_int):
    return bin(input_int).count("1")

@given(some.integers(min_value=0))
@settings(max_examples=500)
def test_gmpy2_popcount(input_int):
    assert count_bits_slow(input_int) == gmpy2.popcount(input_int)
```

For illustrative purposes we have here specified a [@settings(max_examples=500)](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html) decorator to tweak the default number of input values to generate.

The test passes - showing that the optimized, hard to follow code of `gmpy2.popcount` gives the same results as our slower but simpler `count_bits_slow` function. Note that if this was the only reason to bring in gmpy2 as a dependency, it would be wise to benchmark if the performance improvements of it really would outweight the cost and weight of the dependency.

## Finding bugs with property-based testing
We haven't had a failing test yet - let's go hunting! 

So far we've seen how to use it, but we haven't used it to find a bug. Let's put it use. 

The [json5](https://pypi.org/project/json5/) library for [JSON5](https://json5.org/) serialization might be a good fit (besides being a young project and therefore more likely to contain bugs - picked a project that's more likely to have a bug - if you took a random project, it's less likely that you'll uncover a bug - maybe remove):

- One **property** of JSON5 is that it is a superset of JSON.
- Another **property** (which is true of most serialization formats) is that deserializing a serialized string should give us back the original object.

Let's use those properties in a test:

```python
import json
from string import printable

import hypothesis.strategies as some
import json5
from hypothesis import example, given, settings

# Construct a generator of arbitrary objects to test serialization on:
some_object = some.recursive(
    some.none() | some.booleans() | some.floats(allow_nan=False) | some.text(printable),
    lambda children: some.lists(children, min_size=1)
    | some.dictionaries(some.text(printable), children, min_size=1),
)


@given(some_object)
def test_json5_loads(input_object):
    dumped_json_string = json.dumps(input_object)
    dumped_json5_string = json5.dumps(input_object)

    parsed_object_from_json = json5.loads(dumped_json_string)
    parsed_object_from_json5 = json5.loads(dumped_json5_string)

    assert parsed_object_from_json == input_object
    assert parsed_object_from_json5 == input_object
```

After creating a `some_object` generator of arbitrary objects (see [the Hypothesis documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#recursive-data) for details) we verify aspects of the previously mentioned properties: We serialize the input using both `json` and `json5`, then deserialise those two objects back using the `json5` library and asserting that the original object was obtained.

Lo and behold - at the `json5.dumps(input_object)` statement we get an exception inside the internals of the `json5` library:

```python
    def _is_ident(k):
        k = str(k)
>       if not _is_id_start(k[0]) and k[0] not in (u'$', u'_'):
E       IndexError: string index out of range
```

Besides showing the stack trace as usual, we also get an informative message showing the failed **hypothesis**, the generated data causing our test to fail:

```
<!-- ------------- Hypothesis ------------- -->
Falsifying example: test_json5_loads(
    input_object={'': None},
)
```

Using the `{'': None}` input data causing the issue we promptly [reported](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/37) and [fixed](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/38) the bug, which has since been released in version 0.9.4 of the library.

But what about the future - how can we be sure that the problem never resurfaces? While we saw that we currently generated input contained the troublesome input, we want to ensure that this input is always used, even in the face of someone tweaking the `some_object` generator or updating the version of the Hypothesis library used:

```diff

     dumped_json5_string = json5.dumps(input_object)
```

Here we have used the [@example](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reproducing.html#hypothesis.example) decorator to add a hard-coded example in addition to generated input.
