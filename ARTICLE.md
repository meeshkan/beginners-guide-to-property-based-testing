# Introduction to property based testing
Mankind has evolved - perhaps it's time for how we test software to evolve as well?

![Evolution of humans ending up with computer usage](https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/human-evolution-from-monkey-businessman-computer-user-cartoon-vector-characters_53562-7997.jpg?size=626&ext=jpg)

## Example based testing
Normally software testing is done through **example based testing**. A human writes one or several sample inputs to the function or system under test, runs the function or system, and then asserts on the result of that.

Let's start with a toy example - a python [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) function to sort a list of numbers (note: this is a toy example, use [list.sort()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort) in production):

```python
def bubble_sort(nums):
    result = nums.copy()
    swapped = True
    while swapped:
        swapped = False
        for i in range(len(result) - 1):
            if result[i] > result[i + 1]:
                result[i], result[i + 1] = result[i + 1], result[i]
                swapped = True
    return result

def test_bubble_sort_example():
    # Test using two manually worked out examples:
    assert [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] == bubble_sort([5, 3, 1, 4, 2])
    assert [1, 1, 3, 3, 5] == bubble_sort([1, 3, 1, 3, 5])
```

Example based testing is and will continue to be the workhorse in automated software testing - but we will explore an additional technique that might enhance the test coverage of your code.

## Property based testing
While great and simple, testing examples does just that: tests examples that we have come up with! What if we want to test hundreds (or millions) of test cases, possibly ones we could never dream of coming up with ourselves?

In other words: How could we have saved the student records in the example below?

**Property based testing** is a different approach here to help with that. You yourself don't generate the exact input - that is done by by a computer automatically. What you as a developer do is:

- You specify what input to generate.
- You assert on guarantees (hereafter called **properties**) which are true regardless of exact input.

Let's see an example using the [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) test library:

```python
import hypothesis.strategies as some
from hypothesis import given

# Guide the framework in what input we need:
@given(input_list=some.lists(some.integers()))
def test_bubble_sort_properties(input_list):
    input_list_copy = input_list.copy()
    sorted_list = bubble_sort(input_list)

    # Regardless of input, sorting should never change the original list:
    assert input_list_copy == input_list

    # Regardless of input, sorting should never change the size:
    assert len(sorted_list) == len(input_list)

    # Regardless of input, sorting should never change the set of distinct elements:
    assert set(sorted_list) == set(input_list)

    # Regardless of input, each element in the sorted list should be
    # lower or equal to the value that comes after it:
    for i in range(len(sorted_list) - 1):
        assert sorted_list[i] <= sorted_list[i + 1]
```

Here we specify that we want lists of integers as input (using the [@given](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/details.html#hypothesis.given) function decorator) and **asserts on properties that are true regardless of the exact input**.

If we peek on what input is generated by adding a `print(input_list)` statement, we can see 100 different generated input values (the number of runs and specifics of the generated data can be configured, more on that later on):

```
[]
[92]
[66, 24, -25219, 94, -28953, 31131]
[-16316, -367479896]
[-7336253322929551029, -7336253322929551029, 27974, -24308, -64]
...
```

While different, a property based test shares a lot with how an example based test is written, as illustrated in the following comparison of steps:

| Example based                          | Property based                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Set up some data                    | 1. For all data matching some specification |
| 2. Perform some operations on the data | 2. Perform some operations on the data      |
| 3. Assert something about the result   | 3. Assert something about the result        |


## Property: Unexpected exceptions should never be thrown
One thing we got tested "for free" in the above `test_bubble_sort_properties` function, was that the code did not throw any exception. This property - that the code does not throw any exception (or more generally, only expected and documented exceptions, and that it never segfaults) - can be a convenient one to test, especially if the code has a lot of internal assertions.

![Comic about computer complaining about segfaults](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiler_complaint.png)

Let's test that the property that the [json.loads](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads) function in the python standard library never throws any exception other than `json.JSONDecodeError` regardless of input:

```python
@given(some.text())
def test_json_loads(input_string):
    try:
        json.loads(input_string)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return
```

Running the test passes, so what we believe held up under test!

## Property: Symmetry
Symmetry of certain operations can sometimes be used, as in the property that decoding an encoded value always results in the original value.

Let's apply it to [base32-crockford](https://github.com/jbittel/base32-crockford), a python library for the [Base32](https://www.crockford.com/base32.html) encoding format:

```python
@given(some.integers(min_value=0))
def test_base32_crockford(input_int):
      assert base32_crockford.decode(base32_crockford.encode(input_int)) == input_int
```

Since this decoding scheme only works for non-negative integers, we specify to the **generation strategy** of input data to only generate integers with a minium value of zero: `some.integers(min_value=0)`. Once again the test passes.

## Property: A naive method should still give the same result
Sometimes we can get the desired solution through a naive, unpractical way that is not acceptable to use in production code: That might be due to execution time being to slow, memory consumption too high or it requiring special dependencies that are not acceptable to install in production.

![From the Matrix movie: What if I told you.. You are absolutely correct](https://memes.ucoz.com/_nw/41/66267655.jpg)

For an example, consider counting the number of set bits in an (arbitrary sized) integer, where we have an optimized solution from the [pygmp2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

Let's compare with a slower solution that converts the integer to a binary string (using the [bin](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bin) function in the standard library) and then counts the occurences of the string "1" inside it:

```python
def count_bits_slow(input_int):
    return bin(input_int).count("1")

@given(some.integers(min_value=0))
@settings(max_examples=500)
def test_gmpy2_popcount(input_int):
    assert count_bits_slow(input_int) == gmpy2.popcount(input_int)
```

For illustrative purposes we have here specified a [@settings(max_examples=500)](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html) decorator to tweak the default number of input values to generate.

The test passes - showing that the optimized, hard to follow code of `gmpy2.popcount` gives the same results as our slower but simpler `count_bits_slow` function. Note that if this was the only reason to bring in gmpy2 as a dependency, it would be wise to benchmark if the performance improvements of it really would outweight the cost and weight of the dependency.

# Finding an issue in the wild
We haven't had a failing test yet - let's go hunting!

![Comic about debugging, an actual bug crawling out of a computer](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1495963_9LswA.jpg)

The [json5](https://pypi.org/project/json5/) library for [JSON5](https://json5.org/) serialization might be a good fit (besides being a young project and therefore more likely to contain bugs):

- One **property** of JSON5 is that it is a superset of JSON.
- Another **property** (which is true of most serialization formats) is that deserializing a serialized string should give us back the original object.

Let's use those properties in a test:

```python
import json
from string import printable

import hypothesis.strategies as some
import json5
from hypothesis import example, given, settings

# Construct a generator of arbitrary objects to test serialization on:
some_object = some.recursive(
    some.none() | some.booleans() | some.floats(allow_nan=False) | some.text(printable),
    lambda children: some.lists(children, min_size=1)
    | some.dictionaries(some.text(printable), children, min_size=1),
)


@given(some_object)
def test_json5_loads(input_object):
    dumped_json_string = json.dumps(input_object)
    dumped_json5_string = json5.dumps(input_object)

    parsed_object_from_json = json5.loads(dumped_json_string)
    parsed_object_from_json5 = json5.loads(dumped_json5_string)

    assert parsed_object_from_json == input_object
    assert parsed_object_from_json5 == input_object
```

After creating a `some_object` generator of arbitrary objects (see [the Hypothesis documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#recursive-data) for details) we verify aspects of the previously mentioned properties: We serialize the input using both `json` and `json5`, then deserialise those two objects back using the `json5` library and asserting that the original object was obtained.

Lo and behold - at the `json5.dumps(input_object)` statement we get an exception inside the internals of the `json5` library:

```python
    def _is_ident(k):
        k = str(k)
>       if not _is_id_start(k[0]) and k[0] not in (u'$', u'_'):
E       IndexError: string index out of range
```

![Our testers found more bugs than our customers did](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c1eb5bad58ac4d222c17196e0a8f2288)

Besides showing the stack trace as usual, we also get an informative message showing the failed **hypothesis**, the generated data causing our test to fail:

```
------------- Hypothesis -------------
Falsifying example: test_json5_loads(
    input_object={'': None},
)
```

Using the `{'': None}` input data causing the issue we promptly [reported](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/issues/37) and [fixed](https://github.com/dpranke/pyjson5/pull/38) the bug, which has since been released in version 0.9.4 of the library.

But what about the future - how can we be sure that the problem never resurfaces? While we saw that we currently generated input contained the troublesome input, we want to ensure that this input is always used, even in the face of someone tweaking the `some_object` generator or updating the version of the Hypothesis library used:

```diff

     dumped_json5_string = json5.dumps(input_object)
```

Here we have used the [@example](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reproducing.html#hypothesis.example) decorator to add a hard-coded example in addition to generated input.
