# Introduction to property-based testing
This repository contains this README article introducing property-based testing with code samples in python.

# Running the tests
Execute `make` to run the tests (it will setup a `venv` folder and install dependencies there).

  - "This sort of testing is often called 'property-based testing', and the most widely known implementation of the concept is the Haskell library QuickCheck, but Hypothesis differs significantly from QuickCheck and is designed to fit idiomatically and easily into existing styles of testing that you are used to, with absolutely no familiarity with Haskell or functional programming needed."
